#' ## Defining and demystifying APIs
#' 
#' APIs---application programming interfaces---are a structured way 
#' for pieces of software to communicate with each other.
#' 
#' Web APIs allow one computer (a client) to ask another computer (a server) 
#' for some resource over the internet.
#' 

#' ## APIs vs web scraping
#' 
#' You might be more familiar with the idea of **web scraping**, 
#' extracting information from the html of a web page.
#' 
#' Web scraping can be good for simple, static pages---if, for instance, 
#' you want a table from Wikipedia. 
#' It doesn't work at all for complicated, dynamic web sites like Facebook.
#' 
#' In addition, by following Terms of Service and going through 
#' an authentication process, you get a kind of *legitimacy* from 
#' API use that you don't necessarily get from web scraping.
#' 

#' ## Terminology and context
#'
#' Modern web APIs use standard HTTP methods. 
#' 
#' These are verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on.
#' 
#' You make a **request** (to a url, or an *endpoint*) and get a **response**.
#' 
#' Responses have specific components: the status, the headers, and the body.
#' 
#' The body will contain the data you want in some format---most often, JSON.
#' 

#' ## Packages
#' 
#' Our main tool for interacting with APIs from R is the `httr` package: 
library(httr)

#' We need a package to help us work with JSON-formatted files:
library(jsonlite)

#' And we'll also functions from the tidyverse:
#+ warning=FALSE, message=FALSE
library(tidyverse)

#' ## A simple illustration

r <- GET("https://http.cat/200")
r

#' ## Looking at the response

status_code(r)

r_body <- content(r, as = 'raw')
head(r_body)

write_file(r_body, "200.jpg")

#' ##  
#' 
#' ![source: http.cat](200.jpg)
#'

#' ## Example 1: The US Census API
#' 
#' Question: What are the largest Census-designated places in the US?
#' 
#' 

#' ## Example 1: The US Census API
#' 
#' First, read in your API key from a config file: 
census_api_key <- read_lines("census_api_key.txt")

#' This is the base url for the 2015 5-year American Community Survey: 
acs_url <- "https://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs5"

#' ## Documentation
#' 
#' https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html
#' 
#' examples: https://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs5/examples.html
#' 
#' all variables: https://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs5/variables.html
#' 
#' ## Using the documentation
#' 
#' *What syntax do I use to make a request?*
#' 
#' For the Census API, we request variables through the `get` field, 
#' separated by commas. (`"get=VAR1,VAR2"`)
#' 
#' We specify different geographies with the `for` or `in` field, 
#' using `*` to get all locations of a particular type. 
#' (`"for=region:01"`, `"for=tract:*&in=state:01"`)
#' 
#' *What is the information I want called?*
#' 
#' For total population, the estimate is a variable named `B01003_001E`, and
#' the margin of error is `B01003_001M`. We also want the `NAME` of each place.
#' 

#' ## Constructing a query 
#' 
#' We want to attach a query to the end of the url: 
#' 
#' https://url.com/data?q=query&key=YOURKEY
#' 
#' `httr` will do this for us if we put the fields we want into a list:
#' 
acs_query <- list(
  get = "B01003_001E,B01003_001M,NAME",
  `for` = "place:*",
  # "for" is a reserved keyword in R! 
  # You need backticks to use it as a name
  key = census_api_key
)

#' ## Request
acs_r <- GET(url = acs_url, query = acs_query)

#' ## Response
#' 
#' Look at the response. The body is a JSON array that looks like this: 
#' 
#' ```
#' [["B01003_001E","B01003_001M","NAME","state","place"],
#' ["52","52","Abanda CDP, Alabama","01","00100"],
#' ["2646","23","Abbeville city, Alabama","01","00124"],
#' ["4454","21","Adamsville city, Alabama","01","00460"],
#' ["682","154","Addison town, Alabama","01","00484"],
#' ["293","84","Akron town, Alabama","01","00676"],
#' ["31905","63","Alabaster city, Alabama","01","00820"],
#' ...
#' ```

#' ## Data processing
#' 
#' We want to turn this JSON object into a data frame, 
#' using `jsonlite::fromJSON`.
#' 
#' The first row contains the names of the columns; 
#' the remaining rows are values.
#' 
acs_m <- fromJSON(content(acs_r, as = "text"))
acs_df <- as_data_frame(acs_m[-1, ])
colnames(acs_df) <- acs_m[1, ]

#' ##
head(acs_df)

#' ## What are the 10 largest cities in the US?
#' 
acs_df <- 
  acs_df %>%  
  mutate(B01003_001E = as.numeric(B01003_001E), 
         B01003_001M = as.numeric(B01003_001M)) %>%
  arrange(desc(B01003_001E)) %>%
  select(-B01003_001M) 

#' ##
head(acs_df, 10)

#' ## Example 2: The World Bank
#' 
#' The World Bank API offers access to more than 8000 indicators for 
#' the countries of the world, often over long periods of time.
#' 
#' https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589
#' 
#' We will use it to look at the total population over time for one country, 
#' South Africa.
#' 
#' ## Example 2: The World Bank
#' 
wb_url <- "http://api.worldbank.org"

wb_query <- list(
  format = "json"
)
#' 
#' In this case, we will build our queries using path rather than query syntax, 
#' as described here:
#' 
#' https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898581-api-basic-call-structure
#' 
#' ##
#' 
#' This query retrieves basic information about South Africa: 
r_za <- GET(wb_url, 
            path = "countries/za", 
            query = wb_query)
# to view: 
# prettify(content(r_za, as = "text"))

#' This query describes the `SP.POP.TOTL` indicator:
r_pop <- GET(wb_url, 
             path = "indicators/SP.POP.TOTL", 
             query = wb_query)

#' ## Total population for South Africa
#' 
#' To get the total population indicator for South Africa, we combine the two
#' previous queries: 
#' 
r_za_pop <- 
  GET(wb_url, 
      path = "countries/za/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL", 
      query = wb_query)

#' ## Paginated responses
#' 
#' Often, APIs only return a fixed amount of information, e.g. 50 items. 
#' If you want more, you have to ask.
#' 
#' The most recent years are on "page" 2 of 2, which we must query specifically.
#' 
wb_query_pg2 <- list(
  page = 2,
  format = "json"
)

r_za_pop_pg2 <- 
  GET(wb_url, 
      path = "countries/za/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL", 
      query = wb_query_pg2)

#' ## Data processing
#' 
#' R can parse this data into a list, 
#' but then we need to turn it into a data frame.
#' 
#' Here is a function to help us do that:
#' 
process_wb_data <- function(d) {
  as_data_frame(d) %>% 
    unnest() %>%
    select(-decimal) %>%
    group_by(value, date) %>% 
    summarise_all(first) %>% 
    # try out `last` instead of `first` here!
    ungroup()
}

#' ## Data processing
df_pg1 <- 
  map(content(r_za_pop, as = "parsed")[[2]], 
      process_wb_data) %>% 
  bind_rows()

df_pg2 <- 
  map(content(r_za_pop_pg2, as = "parsed")[[2]], 
      process_wb_data) %>% 
  bind_rows()

r_za_pop_df <- 
  bind_rows(df_pg2, df_pg1) %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value), 
         date = as.numeric(date))

#' ## Plot population over time
options(scipen = 99)
za_plot <- 
  ggplot(r_za_pop_df, aes(x = date, y = value)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) + 
  labs(title = "Population of South Africa, 1960-2016", 
       x = NULL, y = NULL)

#' ##
za_plot

#' ## Something old, something new
#' 
#' These examples have focused on accessing more traditional sources of data 
#' in a new way. 
#' 
#' But the obvious promise of APIs is the ability to access *new* data sources
#' ---Google, Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Sometimes the authentication
#' might be more complicated, or the documentation more technical, but the 
#' principle is the same.
#' 
#' ## An alternative: specialized packages
#' 
#' Many of the most common APIs you might want to use have dedicated R packages
#' that wrap them and make them easier to interact with. 
#' 
#' For example, there's [`tidycensus`](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) 
#' for the Census, and [`rtimes`](https://github.com/rOpenGov/rtimes) for the 
#' New York Times. 
#' 
#' Often, these packages are based on `httr`!
#' 
#' ## But...
#' 
#' - ...what if the API you want to use doesn't have a package?
#' - ...what if you want to access API functionality the package doesn't support?
#' - ...what if the API updates, and the package breaks?
#' 
#' ## Takeaways
#' 
#' General mental model for how APIs work, 
#' and a versatile tool for interacting with them, `httr`. 
#' 
#' 
#' Sense of how to find the information you want from the original documentation.
#' 
#' Some comfort with manipulating data from raw JSON into a form you can use.
#' 
#' ## Exercises
#'
#' **Exercise 1:**
#' Use the 2016 1-year ACS to get the population of every state. 
#' What are the 5 smallest states?
#' 
#' url: https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1
#' 
#' Be sure to look at the 1-year ACS documentation on 
#' https://www.census.gov/developers/ rather than the 5-year documentation.   
#' 



#' **Exercise 2:** 
#' Request population indicators for three other countries from the 
#' World Bank API and plot their population change over time.
#' 
#' Use two-digit country codes for countries: 
#' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
#' 



#' ## Exercises
#'
#' **Challenge exercise:** 
#' Check out this list of APIs for social science maintained by Chris Bail: 
#' 
#' https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZEr3okdlb0zctmX0MZKo-gZKPsq5WGn1nJOxPV7al-Q/edit?usp=sharing
#' 
#' Sign up for one that looks interesting and request a piece of data from it. 
#' Try to figure out how to get that data into an R-friendly format like a 
#' data frame, and display some of it. Why might the data be of interest to
#' demographers?
